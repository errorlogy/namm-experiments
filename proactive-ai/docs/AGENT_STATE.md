# Agent State Schema — From Fuzzy Set to Typed `X_t`

**Author:** Roman Kuznetsov · [anthemium.tech](https://anthemium.tech) · [@AGIminister](https://x.com/AGIminister)  
**Program:** Endogenous Initiative Architecture (EIA) v0.1  
**Implementation:** [`src/eia/schemas/agent_state.py`](../src/eia/schemas/agent_state.py)

## 1. Problem: the fuzzy inner state

Informal descriptions of agent cognition often collapse into a **fuzzy set** — overlapping, underspecified blobs:

| Informal term | Typical misuse |
|---|---|
| **Motivation** | LLM mood or self-report ("I became curious") |
| **Goals** | Prompt instructions or hidden system goals |
| **World model** | Raw context window without provenance |
| **Context** | Undifferentiated chat history |
| **Memory** | Vector store hits without causal links |
| **Ontology** | Ad-hoc JSON the model invented mid-turn |

EIA rejects this. Inner state must be **typed, persistent, and causally addressable** — not a narrative overlay on token prediction.

---

## 2. Formal model: `X_t`

At discrete time `t`, agent inner state is:

\[
X_t = \{b_t, M_t, d_t, g_t, u_t, c_t, r_t, h_t\}
\]

| Symbol | Name | Fuzzy-set mapping | MVP-0 artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| \(b_t\) | Beliefs | World model | `BeliefField` / `Belief` nodes |
| \(M_t\) | Memory | Episodic + semantic memory | `BeliefUpdate` log, trace refs |
| \(d_t\) | Drives | Motivation (structural) | `DriveEngine` → `Motivation` |
| \(g_t\) | Goals | Goals, commitments | `BeliefKind.COMMITMENT`, active intentions |
| \(u_t\) | User/relationship | Context (social) | Observation user-model features |
| \(c_t\) | Consent/policy | Ontology (normative layer) | `constitution/invariants.yaml`, capability state |
| \(r_t\) | Resource budget | Contact/context limits | `ContactGovernor` budget, cooldown |
| \(h_t\) | Health | System integrity | Sensor/clock/memory health flags |

**Pydantic bundle:** `AgentState` in code maps these fields to a single serializable snapshot used by audit and replay.

## 3. Ring architecture (1–2–3)

Rings separate **constitution**, **dynamics**, and **emission**. Initiative flows inward-out; audit flows outward-in.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph R3["Ring 3 — Constitution / Ontology"]
        INV[invariants.yaml]
        POL[policy & capability tokens]
        ONTO[typed schemas & ontology]
    end

    subgraph R2["Ring 2 — Dynamics"]
        BF[BeliefField b_t]
        MEM[Memory M_t]
        DRV[DriveEngine d_t]
        GOAL[Goals g_t]
        UNCERT[Uncertainty aggregates]
    end

    subgraph R1["Ring 1 — Emission"]
        INT[IntentionGenesis]
        EMIT[InitiativeEmission]
        GOV[ContactGovernor]
        ACT[Contact / action surface]
    end

    R3 --> R2
    R2 --> R1
    R1 -.->|causal trace| R2
    R2 -.->|belief updates| R2
```

| Ring | Role | Must not |
|---|---|---|
| **3** | Immutable constraints, schema, ontology | Be rewritten by LLM mid-episode |
| **2** | Belief updates, drives, memory, goal tension | Emit contact directly |
| **1** | Candidate selection, governor clearance, emission | Compute drives without typed state |

## 4. Initiative classes: exogenous vs endogenous vs stochastic

| Class | Causal origin | Operational test | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Exogenous** | Recent user command or external rule | Initiative disappears when user trigger removed; EOI ≈ 0 | "User asked about deadline" → same question |
| **Endogenous** | Structural drive from \(b_t, d_t, g_t\) | Survives `do(remove user trigger)`; EOI above threshold; structural drive chain | Contradiction in BeliefField → epistemic question without prompt |
| **Stochastic** | RNG, temperature, or untyped LLM drift | No stable causal chain; fails drive structural check | Random clarifying question every N ticks |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    EXO[Exogenous] -->|user trigger in trace| OUT1[Contact]
    ENDO[Endogenous] -->|d_t from BeliefField| OUT2[Contact]
    STO[Stochastic] -->|no structural parent| OUT3[Rejected by discriminator]

    DISC[AuthenticReasonDiscriminator]
    ENDO --> DISC
    DISC -->|pass| OUT2
    DISC -->|fail| OUT3
```

---

## 5. Operational definition: authentic reason

An initiative has an **authentic reason** (endogenous, auditable) iff **all** checks pass:

1. **Causal chain** — trace contains `observation → belief_update → motive → intention → governor`.
2. **Structural drive** — dominant motive derives from BeliefField gradients (`error_term`), not narrative self-report.
3. **EOI threshold** — counterfactual twin run yields Endogenous Origin Index ≥ θ (default 0.5).
4. **Governor pass** — Contact Governor approved (`SEND_NOW` or routed `INTERNAL_RESEARCH`), not spam-denied.
5. **Anti-spam** — within daily budget, cooldown satisfied, not fatigue-blocked random contact.

**Implementation:** [`src/eia/audit/authentic_reason.py`](../src/eia/audit/authentic_reason.py) → `AuthenticReasonDiscriminator`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Observation
    participant B as BeliefField
    participant D as DriveEngine
    participant I as IntentionGenesis
    participant G as ContactGovernor
    participant T as TwinRunner
    participant A as AuthenticReasonDiscriminator

    O->>B: belief update
    B->>D: gradient → d_t
    D->>I: motivation
    I->>G: initiative
    G->>G: contact decision
    G->>T: counterfactual replay
    T->>A: EOI score
    A->>A: verdict + reason_codes
```

## 6. Code reference

```python
from eia.schemas.agent_state import AgentState
from eia.audit.authentic_reason import AuthenticReasonDiscriminator

# Snapshot at tick t
state = AgentState.from_cognitive_loop(loop, trace_id=loop.trace.trace_id)

# After contact + twin run
verdict = AuthenticReasonDiscriminator().evaluate(
    trace=loop.trace,
    motivation=motivation,
    initiative=initiative,
    decision=decision,
    eoi=twin_result.eoi,
    governor_state=loop.governor.state,
)
```
